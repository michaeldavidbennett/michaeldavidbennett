- Hi, I’m Michael David Bennett
- I’m a Chartered Financial Analyst and member of the CFA Institute and Personal Finance Society.
- I am certified and recommended by the SEC and FINRA as an Investment Advisor and Broker with over 30 years experience in the finance industry.
- As a seasoned financial expert, I offer professional and unbiased financial advice to anyone looking to change their financial situation. I can help with retirement planning, investing, saving, buying a property or managing your finances.  I work with you to understand your goals, preferences and risk tolerance, and then I recommend the best products and strategies for you.
- It is always important to verify the authenticity of your Financial Advisor to ensure you don't entrust your finances to the wrong person. You can View My `SEC Certification` [HERE](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/individual/individual_1633152.pdf).
